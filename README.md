Introduction
------------

As Yelp becomes the common platform for social evaluation of local businesses, we expect that attributes of the Yelp dataset become increasingly better predictors of real-world business performance, including a business's searchability aspect.

Brunchbox is geared toward those who need a quick and simple way to keep track of relevant businesses in multiple locations.



Future enhancements
---------------
1. Add more advanced filters for various categories like cuisine, ambience, etc.

2. Add voice based search

3. Improvements to the visualization
Add radial bubble chart (see the mockup image) that can clearly illustrate potential matches that are within user's epicenter.
Add custom icons on individual bubbles that can provide clean separation of various categories and subcategories (restaurants, breakfast places, etc.)


3. Solve metacrap problem 
 When people move to a new city, it is hard to keep track of restaurants and other venues that fit their tastes. Brunchbox aims to take the pain away from keeping track of your favorite places. Users can choose to bookmark interesting places by existing tags and add to their favorites list.

4. Add ability to encode your own Yelp memex 
Pull data from facebook/foursquare checkins to build a personalized memex that can be mapped with the local data.


Known Issues
---------
Icons are not correctly overlayed on each individual bubble.
