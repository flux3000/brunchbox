Introduction
------------

As Yelp becomes the common platform for social evaluation of local businesses, we expect that attributes of the Yelp dataset become increasingly better predictors of real-world business performance, including a business's searchability aspect.

BrunchBox is geared toward those who need a quick and simple way to keep track of relevant businesses in multiple locations.

And by "relevant businesses", we of course mean the most relevant meal to one's happiness, brunch. BrunchBox takes a user's location and uses the Yelp API to filter out all the brunch areas near the user. Depending on how far the user wants to travel, she can reduce or increase the distance away to show results from between 0.1 and 5 miles.

Technologies used
------------
HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript, Google Geolocation API, Google Geocoding API, Yelp API


Potential future enhancements
---------------

- Add animations upon submit - e.g. rearrangement of circles
- Add ability to sort by either distance or rating
- Add concentric-circle-layout bubble chart that can clearly illustrate potential matches that are within user's epicenter.
- Add custom icons on individual bubbles that can provide clean separation of various categories and subcategories (restaurants, coffee places, etc.)
- Solve metacrap problem: When people move to a new city, it is hard to keep track of restaurants and other venues that fit their tastes. Brunchbox aims to take the pain away from keeping track of your favorite places. Users can choose to bookmark interesting places by existing tags and add to their favorites list.
- Add ability to encode your own Yelp memex: Pull data from facebook/foursquare checkins to build a personalized memex that can be mapped with the local data.
